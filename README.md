### Hi there 👋
I'm Wilson and I'm a developer specializing in front end development, specifically in the React.js ecosystem. I also dabble in backend dev, dev ops, and some infrastructure type things as well, but front end is where I'm most comfortable! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a community developer at [Send Chinatown Love](http://sendchinatownlove.com/)
- 🔍 I'm actively looking for a full time front end developer position!
